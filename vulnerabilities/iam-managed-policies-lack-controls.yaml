summary: |
  Repeated examples of AWS releasing or changing IAM policies they obviously 
  shouldn''t have (CheesepuffsServiceRolePolicy, AWSServiceRoleForThorInternalDevPolicy,
  AWSCodeArtifactReadOnlyAccess.json, AmazonCirrusGammaRoleForInstaller). The worst
  being the ReadOnlyAccess policy having almost all privileges removed and unexpected
  ones added.
