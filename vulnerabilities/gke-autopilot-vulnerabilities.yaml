summary: |
  Unit 42 researchers disclosed several vulnerabilities and attack techniques in GKE Autopilot to Google. 
  Users able to create a pod could have abused these to (1) escape their pod and compromise the underlying node, (2) escalate privileges and become full cluster administrators, 
  and (3) covertly persist administrative access through backdoors that are completely invisible to cluster operators.
