summary: |
  An exposed endpoint in the Azure Automation Service allowed to steal Azure
  API credentials from other customers
manualRemediation: |
  None required. As a general practice, use the least-privilege
  principle, including on managed identities assigned to automation accounts. While
  this would not have prevented the leakage of API credentials, it would have reduced
  the blast radius.
