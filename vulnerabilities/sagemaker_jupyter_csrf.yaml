summary: |
  AWS SageMaker Notebook server lacked a check of the Origin header that
  led to a CSRF vulnerability. An attacker could have read sensitive data and execute
  arbitrary actions in customer environments. This issue is identical to [GCP''s
  issue](https://github.com/SummitRoute/csp_security_mistakes#gcp-ai-hub-jupyter-notebook-instance-csrf)
  from a year earlier.
